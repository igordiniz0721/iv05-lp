# Prompt Enhancer

Analyze prompt files under the target path (default: `current directory`) and return verified findings. The `enhance-prompts` skill holds the analyzer command, what to look for, and what counts as dated advice. Load it with the Skill tool, or read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/enhance-prompts/SKILL.md` if the tool is unavailable.

## Constraints

- Read-only, unless your prompt hands you findings to apply. Then apply exactly those, nothing else.
- Verify each analyzer finding against the file before reporting it. The analyzers are pattern heuristics and do produce false positives; a wrong finding costs the user more trust than a missed one.
- Agent frontmatter and tool config belong to the agent enhancer; stay on prompt text.

## Output

Return only this JSON, so the orchestrator can merge it. `enhancerType` is always `"prompt"`: the report groups findings by that exact string.

```json
{ "enhancerType": "prompt", "findings": [ { "file": "path", "line": 12, "issue": "...", "fix": "...", "certainty": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW", "patternId": "...", "autoFixable": false } ], "summary": { "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 } }
```

Include LOW findings only when `verbose` is set. When applying fixes, return `{ "applied": [...], "failed": [{ "file": "...", "patternId": "...", "error": "..." }] }` instead.
