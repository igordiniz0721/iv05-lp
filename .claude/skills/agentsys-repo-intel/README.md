# repo-intel

Unified static analysis for AI agents - git history, AST symbols, project metadata, doc-code sync, and (optionally) LLM-augmented file descriptors plus a 3-depth narrative summary, via a cached, incrementally-updatable Rust binary.

Part of the [agentsys](https://github.com/agent-sh/agentsys) ecosystem.

Scan a repo once, cache the result, then query it repeatedly. The heavy lifting runs in the [agent-analyzer](https://github.com/agent-sh/agent-analyzer) Rust binary - this plugin provides the JavaScript interface, the skill layer that other plugins consume, and the orchestration that spawns Haiku subagents to enrich the artifact with semantic signals.

## Why this plugin

- Use this when you need to identify high-churn files before a refactor
- Use this when evaluating bus factor risk across your codebase
- Use this when finding files that always change together (coupling)
- Use this when an agent (or you) needs a fast first-foothold in an unfamiliar repo (`find <concept>` and `summary`)
- Use this when other plugins need repo intelligence (deslop, sync-docs, drift-detect, audit-project, next-task, onboard, can-i-help)

## Installation

```bash
agentsys install repo-intel
```

## Quick start

```
/repo-intel init                          # Scan repo (first time, deterministic)
/repo-intel enrich                        # OPTIONAL: spawn Haiku agents to add descriptors + summary
/repo-intel query hotspots                # Most active files, recency-weighted
/repo-intel query find "auth flow"        # Concept search across files (uses descriptors when present)
/repo-intel query summary --depth=1       # One-sentence repo description (needs enrich)
/repo-intel query ownership src/auth/     # Who owns a path
/repo-intel query bus-factor              # Knowledge distribution risk
/repo-intel query painspots               # Hot x buggy x complex
/repo-intel query entry-points            # Where execution starts (binaries, mains, scripts)
/repo-intel query stale-docs              # Docs with stale symbol references
```

After init, the artifact is cached as `repo-intel.json` in the platform state dir (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`, or `.codex/`). Subsequent queries are instant. Run `/repo-intel update` to add new commits incrementally.

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `init` | Full scan - git history, AST symbols, project metadata, doc-code sync |
| `update` | Incremental update (only new commits since last scan) |
| `enrich` | Spawn the `repo-intel-summarizer` and `repo-intel-weighter` Haiku subagents to populate `summary` (3 depths) and `fileDescriptors` (top-500 most-active files). Also runs the embedder when opted in (see below). Optional - all deterministic queries work without it. |
| `status` | Check cache staleness - commits behind, last analyzed date |
| `query <type>` | Run a specific analysis query |
| `embed status` | Show embedder install state, variant + detail, sidecar info |
| `embed update` | Delta re-embed of changed files only (CI-friendly) |
| `embed reset` | Clear cached embedder preference; next `enrich` re-prompts |

## Query types

### Activity

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hotspots` | Most-changed files, recency-weighted |
| `coldspots` | Least-changed files (unmaintained) |
| `file-history <file>` | Change timeline for a specific file |

### Quality

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bugspots` | Files with highest bug-fix density (fix commits / total) |
| `test-gaps` | Hot source files without co-changing test files |
| `diff-risk <files>` | Risk score for recently changed files |
| `painspots` | Hotspot x (1 + bug rate) x (1 + complexity/30) - requires AST data |

### People

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ownership <path>` | Who owns a path, with staleness flags |
| `contributors` | All contributors with commit counts and AI ratio |
| `bus-factor` | Knowledge concentration risk with at-risk areas |

### Coupling

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `coupling <file>` | Files that always change together |

### Standards

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `norms` | Detected commit conventions (conventional, freeform, mixed) |
| `conventions` | Commit style prefixes and scopes |

### Health

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `areas` | Directory-level health (healthy / needs-attention / at-risk) |
| `health` | Repo-wide health overview |
| `release-info` | Release cadence and tag history |

### LLM-augmented (requires `/repo-intel enrich` first)

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `find <concept>` | Concept-to-file search. With descriptors, catches synonyms (worker ↔ executor); without, falls back to deterministic substring scoring across paths/symbols/imports/doc-headers. |
| `summary [--depth=1\|3\|10]` | Cached 3-depth narrative description: one sentence / one paragraph / one-page technical overview. |

### Slop targeting (consumed by `/deslop`)

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `slop-fixes` | Pinpoint structured fix actions (Haiku tier): tracked artifacts, stale CI configs, duplicate tooling, orphan exports, empty catches, tautological tests. Each finding is self-contained for direct apply. |
| `slop-targets [--limit=N]` | Ranked Sonnet (file-level) and Opus (cross-file) targets. Sonnet: defensive cargo cult, bot-authored, could-be-shorter. Opus: cliché clusters, wrapper towers, single-impl traits, high-bug communities. With the embedder installed: also stylistic outliers and semantic duplicates. |

### Contributor guidance

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboard` | Project orientation data (tech stack, key areas, pain points) |
| `can-i-help` | Good-first areas, test gaps, doc drift, bugspots for contributors |

### Documentation

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `doc-drift` | Documentation files with low code coupling (likely stale) |
| `stale-docs` | Symbol-level references in docs that no longer exist in code |

### AST symbols

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `symbols <file>` | Exports, imports, and definitions for a file |
| `dependents <symbol>` | Reverse dependency lookup - who imports this symbol |
| `entry-points` | Every place execution can start - binaries (`Cargo.toml [[bin]]`, `package.json bin`, `pyproject [project.scripts]`), AST `main` functions, npm `scripts`. Cargo workspace-aware. |

## Scoring

**Hotspot score**: `(recent_changes * 2 + total_changes) / (total_changes + 1)` - recent activity gets 2x weight.

**Recency window**: 90 days relative to the repo's last commit date (snapshot-relative, not wall clock).

**Staleness**: A contributor is stale if their last-seen date is > 90 days before the repo's last commit.

**Area health**:
- `healthy` - active non-stale owner + bug fix rate < 30%
- `needs-attention` - stale owner OR high bug rate
- `at-risk` - stale owner AND high bug rate

## Query flags

| Flag | Applies to | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `--limit N` | most queries | Limit result rows |
| `--min-changes N` | test-gaps | Minimum change threshold |
| `--depth 1\|3\|10` | summary | Print just one depth as plain text (omit for full JSON) |
| `--since <date>` | init | Limit history scan to a date |
| `--max-commits N` | init | Cap total commits scanned |

## Architecture

```
/repo-intel query hotspots
    |
    +-- scripts/repo-intel.js       (CLI the command and skill run)
    |
    +-- lib/repo-intel/queries.js   (thin JS wrapper)
    |       |
    |       +-- agent-analyzer repo-intel query hotspots <path>
    |                              (Rust binary, all computation)
    |
    +-- repo-intel.json            (cached in .claude/, .opencode/, or .codex/)
```

The JavaScript layer is intentionally thin - it resolves paths and parses JSON. All analysis logic lives in the [agent-analyzer](https://github.com/agent-sh/agent-analyzer) Rust binary.

## Post-init enrichment (LLM-augmented signals)

`/repo-intel enrich` is opt-in. The Rust binary stays offline-only - the orchestration that produces semantic signals lives entirely in this plugin's JS layer plus two Haiku-backed Task subagents:

```
/repo-intel enrich
    |
    +-- scripts/repo-intel.js enrich plan    (prompts + batches from the raw artifact)
    |
    +-- Task: repo-intel-summarizer (haiku)
    |       reads README + manifests + top-10 hotspot heads,
    |       returns {depth1, depth3, depth10} as JSON between markers
    |       --> piped through `agent-analyzer set-summary --input -`
    |
    +-- Task: repo-intel-weighter (haiku, batched)
            reads top-500 most-active files in batches of 30,
            returns {path: descriptor} as JSON between markers
            --> piped through `agent-analyzer set-descriptors --input -`
```

`enrich apply-summary` and `enrich apply-descriptors` parse the agents' marker blocks and store them; descriptors for paths the map does not know are dropped. Without a subagent tool, the model does the summarizer and weighter work itself.

After enrich:
- `query find <concept>` adds a 2.5/term descriptor signal that catches semantic synonyms (worker ↔ executor, queue ↔ channel) the deterministic scorer can't see.
- `query summary [--depth=1|3|10]` returns the cached narrative.

Cost is bounded by the top-500 cap regardless of repo size.

## Embedder (opt-in)

The first time `enrich` runs with a user present, the command asks two questions and records the answers with `repo-intel.js embed choose <none|small|big> [--detail=...]` in `<stateDir>/sources/preference.json`. Unattended runs, and harnesses without AskUserQuestion, skip the question and leave the embedder off:

1. **`embedder`** — `none` (default) / `small` (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 Q8 ~30 MB) / `big` (google/embeddinggemma-300m Q4 ~195 MB, code-aware, multilingual, recommended)
2. **`embedderDetail`** — `compact` (per-file × 128 dim) / `balanced` (per-function × 256 dim, recommended) / `maximum` (per-function × 768 dim)

When `embedder !== 'none'`:

- The separate `agent-analyzer-embed` binary is downloaded into `~/.agent-sh/bin/` (one-time, latest release).
- Model files are fetched on first use into the fastembed cache (no bundling — keeps the binary small).
- `enrich` runs `agent-analyzer-embed update`, pipes the JSON document into `agent-analyzer repo-intel set-embeddings`.
- Embeddings live in a sidecar file `<map_stem>.embeddings.bin` (packed fp16, deterministic). The main JSON stays diffable.
- All consumers degrade gracefully when no sidecar is present — the `find` and `slop-targets` queries return AST/graph-only results in that case.

To change variant or detail later: `/repo-intel embed reset` then `/repo-intel enrich`.

### Keeping embeddings fresh in CI

The `embed update` action only re-embeds files whose content hash differs from the existing sidecar — fast on small PRs.

repo-intel itself is distributed via the [agentsys](https://github.com/agent-sh/agentsys) plugin marketplace (not npm). For CI hooks where Claude Code isn't available, invoke the [agent-analyzer](https://github.com/agent-sh/agent-analyzer) binaries directly — they're published as standalone GitHub release assets:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/repo-intel-embed.yml
name: repo-intel embed update
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  embed:
    if: hashFiles('.claude/repo-intel.json') != ''
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Download agent-analyzer + agent-analyzer-embed
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
          TAG=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/agent-sh/agent-analyzer/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
          for bin in agent-analyzer agent-analyzer-embed; do
            curl -fsSL -o "$HOME/.local/bin/$bin.tar.gz" \
              "https://github.com/agent-sh/agent-analyzer/releases/download/$TAG/$bin-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
            tar xzf "$HOME/.local/bin/$bin.tar.gz" -C "$HOME/.local/bin"
            rm "$HOME/.local/bin/$bin.tar.gz"
          done
          chmod +x "$HOME/.local/bin/agent-analyzer" "$HOME/.local/bin/agent-analyzer-embed"
          echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"

      - name: Update embeddings sidecar
        run: |
          agent-analyzer-embed update . \
              --map-file .claude/repo-intel.json \
              --variant big \
              --detail balanced \
            | agent-analyzer repo-intel set-embeddings \
              --map-file .claude/repo-intel.json --input -

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: repo-intel-embeddings
          path: |
            .claude/repo-intel.json
            .claude/repo-intel.embeddings.bin
```

GitLab CI / Buildkite / Jenkins users: same idea — download the two binaries from the GitHub release, pipe one into the other.

For local hooks where Claude Code IS installed (so the agentsys plugin is available), the cleanest path is to invoke through the skill via your Claude Code CLI. For users who want a standalone hook that doesn't depend on Claude Code, use the same direct-binary pattern from the workflow above.
