# mojo

> Skill that teaches any coding agent to write idiomatic, correct Mojo. Distributed via the agent-sh marketplace.

**Repository**: https://github.com/agent-sh/mojo

Follow the Karpathy Guidelines (simplicity, surgical changes, clear success criteria) when editing this plugin.

## Writing Mojo (read first)

Before writing, porting, or reviewing any Mojo, apply `skills/mojo/SKILL.md` and prefer it over pretrained knowledge. WHY: Mojo changed substantially in 2025-2026, so pretrained Mojo syntax is likely stale and will warn or fail to compile. The skill carries the old-to-current map (`def` not `fn`, `var`/`imm`/`mut` not `owned`/`read`/`inout`, `comptime` not `alias`, `Pointer` with `unsafe_` operations not `UnsafePointer`, GPU imports from `max` not `std`, `TestSuite` not `mojo test`) plus short references and links to current upstream docs. Target version: Mojo 1.1.0. Verify unstable APIs against https://mojolang.org/docs/, not memory.

## Project Instruction Files

- `CLAUDE.md` is the project memory entrypoint for Claude Code.
- `AGENTS.md` is a byte-for-byte copy of `CLAUDE.md` for tools that read `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Cline, Copilot).
- Keep them identical. When editing one, update the other in the same commit.

## Critical Rules

1. **Plain text output** - No emojis, no ASCII art. Use `[OK]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARN]`, `[CRITICAL]` for status markers.
2. **No unnecessary files** - Create only the files a task needs; skip summary, plan, audit, and temp docs unless required.
3. **Task is not done until it passes** - Every feature/fix needs quality tests, and `agnix` must be green before merge.
4. **Create PRs for non-trivial changes** - No direct pushes to main.
5. **Always run git hooks** - Let pre-commit and pre-push hooks run; never bypass them.
6. **Use single dash for em-dashes** - In prose, use ` - ` (single dash with spaces), never ` -- `. Does not apply to CLI flags like `--help`.
7. **Report script failures before manual fallback** - Surface broken tooling; never silently bypass it.
8. **Address all PR review comments** - Even minor ones. If you disagree, respond in the review thread.
9. **Wait for the claude workflow before merging** - It is the major quality gate and most thorough review; merge only after it passes.
10. **Follow the skill/command flow exactly** - If a flow specifies subagents, tools, or phases, follow them in order with no deviations.
11. **Token efficiency** - Save tokens over decorations.

## Skill Conventions

- `skills/mojo/SKILL.md` is the authoritative source of truth for how agents write Mojo; mirror any guidance added here into it.
- Keep the skill file to the version map and the rules that apply to every task. Short, verified notes per area go in `skills/mojo/references/`; link to current upstream docs (mojolang.org, max.modular.com) for depth.
- Prefer cross-tool features. Clearly gate any tool-specific behavior.
- Triggers should fire on realistic prompts ("write Mojo", "port this to Mojo", "is this Mojo idiomatic"). Keep the description short and name what it does not cover (pure Python, MAX serving).
- Ground Mojo guidance in current upstream docs, not memory - the language is young and changes fast. Cite sources for non-obvious rules.

## Model Selection

| Model | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Opus** | Complex reasoning, analysis, planning |
| **Sonnet** | Validation, pattern matching, most agents |
| **Haiku** | Mechanical execution, no judgment needed |

## Core Priorities

1. User DX (plugin users first)
2. Worry-free automation
3. Token efficiency
4. Quality output
5. Simplicity

## Testing

Before considering changes complete:
- Run `agnix` on the skill (zero errors).
- Verify the skill activates on realistic prompts in Claude Code and at least one other tool (Cursor or Codex recommended).
