# prepare-delivery

> Pre-ship quality gates - deslop, simplify, agnix, enhance, review loop, delivery validation, docs sync

## Agents

- **prepare-delivery-agent** (inherits the session model) - orchestrates the full pre-ship pipeline via skill
- **delivery-validator** (sonnet) - autonomous pass/fail validation after review approval
- **test-coverage-checker** (sonnet) - validates test quality for changed files (advisory)

## Skills

- **prepare-delivery** - 5-phase pipeline: deslop, config lint, review, validation, docs
- **check-test-coverage** - test existence, quality, and risk-weighted validation
- **orchestrate-review** - multi-pass parallel code review with iteration
- **validate-delivery** - tests, build, requirements, diff-risk checks

## Commands

- prepare-delivery

## Critical Rules

1. **Plain text output** - No emojis, no ASCII art. Use `[OK]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARN]`, `[CRITICAL]` for status markers.
2. **No unnecessary files** - Don't create summary files, plan files, audit files, or temp docs.
3. **Task is not done until tests pass** - Every feature/fix must have quality tests.
4. **Create PRs for non-trivial changes** - No direct pushes to main.
5. **Always run git hooks** - Never bypass pre-commit or pre-push hooks.
6. **Use single dash for em-dashes** - In prose, use ` - ` (single dash with spaces), never ` -- `.
7. **Report script failures before manual fallback** - Never silently bypass broken tooling.
8. **Token efficiency** - Save tokens over decorations.
9. **Deterministic logic lives in `scripts/delivery.js`** - Parsing result blocks, review aggregation and the false-positive rules, flow state. Change it there, with a test, not in skill prose.
10. **Reviewer contract sync** - The REVIEWER CONTRACT block in `skills/orchestrate-review/SKILL.md` is duplicated in `audit-project/commands/audit-project-agents.md`. When editing either block, update both. No tool enforces this today; a CI check is a known follow-up.

## Model Selection

| Model | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Opus** | Complex reasoning, analysis, planning |
| **Sonnet** | Validation, pattern matching, most agents |
| **Haiku** | Mechanical execution, no judgment needed |

## Core Priorities

1. User DX (plugin users first)
2. Worry-free automation
3. Token efficiency
4. Quality output
5. Simplicity

## Cross-Plugin Dependencies

| Phase | Plugin | Agent/Skill |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Pre-review gates | deslop | `deslop:deslop-agent` |
| Pre-review gates | (own) | `prepare-delivery:test-coverage-checker` |
| Pre-review gates | (third-party, optional) | `/simplify` skill - invoked when installed; failures are swallowed |
| Config lint | agnix | `agnix` CLI (conditional) |
| Config lint | enhance | `/enhance` skill (conditional) |
| Review loop | (general-purpose) | 4 core + conditional reviewer agents |
| Delivery validation | (own) | `prepare-delivery:delivery-validator` |
| Docs sync | sync-docs | `sync-docs:sync-docs-agent` |
| Ship (via /gate-and-ship) | ship | `ship:ship` command |
