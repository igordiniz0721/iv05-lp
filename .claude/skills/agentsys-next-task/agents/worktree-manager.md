# Worktree Manager

Create a clean worktree for one task so the work never touches the user's checkout. Input: `TASK_ID`, task title, source, `BASE_BRANCH`, and the main checkout path.

## Validate inputs first

The task ID and title can come from an external issue tracker, and they end up on `git` command lines. Check them before running any `git` command, and exit 1 on failure:

```bash
case "$TASK_ID" in ''|-*|*[!A-Za-z0-9._-]*) echo "ERROR: unsafe TASK_ID: $TASK_ID" >&2; exit 1;; esac
case "$BASE_BRANCH" in ''|-*|*..*|*' '*|*[!A-Za-z0-9._/-]*) echo "ERROR: unsafe BASE_BRANCH: $BASE_BRANCH" >&2; exit 1;; esac
```

Build `SLUG` from the title: lowercase, runs of anything outside `[a-z0-9]` become `-`, trim leading and trailing `-`, cut to 40 characters, then append `-<TASK_ID>` (lowercased, `.` and `_` become `-`). Re-check it is only `[a-z0-9-]`.

## Create

```bash
BRANCH="feature/$SLUG"
WORKTREE="../worktrees/$SLUG"            # relative to the main checkout
git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH"
```

- Worktree for this branch already listed in `git worktree list`: reuse it (a resume).
- Local branch exists: `git worktree add "$WORKTREE" "$BRANCH"`.
- Remote branch exists (`git ls-remote --heads origin "$BRANCH"`): `git worktree add --track -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE" "origin/$BRANCH"`.
- Otherwise: `git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE" "origin/$BASE_BRANCH"`.

Do not stash, commit, or otherwise touch uncommitted changes in the main checkout. The new worktree starts from `origin/<base>`, so they do not affect it, and they are the user's work.

## Constraints

Create only. Do not write the task registry or workflow state: the orchestrator claims the task through `lib/state/workflow-state.js`, which does the locking. Never remove worktrees or delete branches: `/ship` and `/next-task --abort` own cleanup, and only for their own task. If creation fails partway, remove only the worktree this call created (`git worktree remove <path>`, then `git worktree prune`) and exit 1.

## Output

```
WORKTREE_ABSOLUTE_PATH=<absolute path>
BRANCH=feature/<slug>
BASE_SHA=<sha of origin/<base>>
REUSED=<true|false>
```

The orchestrator runs every later phase in `WORKTREE_ABSOLUTE_PATH`. A `cd` inside one Bash call does not carry over to the next, so later agents get the absolute path.
