# enhance-prompts

Find what in a prompt makes a current model do worse: missing context, dated scaffolding, unclear output contracts. Input (`$ARGUMENTS`): a path (default `.`), `--fix`, `--verbose`. This skill is also the shared reference for the agent, project-memory and skills enhancers.

## Run the analyzer

```bash
node -e 'const a=require(process.argv[1]); console.log(JSON.stringify(a.analyzeAllPrompts(process.argv[2]), null, 2))' \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/enhance/prompt-analyzer.js" "<path>"
```

For one file use `analyzePrompt(<file>)`. The result has `summary` and `findings` (`issue`, `fix`, `certainty`, `patternId`, `line`). Verify each finding against the text, then add what the analyzer cannot see (below).

## What current models need

Current models (recent Claude, GPT and strong open models) follow instructions closely and literally. Text written for older models now hurts: emphasis makes them over-apply a rule, step scripts make them rigid, and repeated rules make them reconcile wordings instead of working. Judge a prompt by whether each line carries something only the author knows.

Keep and strengthen:

- **Context**: audience, product, environment facts, the quality bar, and the reason behind each constraint. A rule with its reason generalizes; a bare rule gets applied where it does not fit.
- **Goal and done criteria**: what success looks like and how to check it.
- **Real constraints**: safety, destructive operations, data handling, external posting. State each once, plainly, with the reason.
- **Exact commands for fragile operations**: where only one sequence is safe, a script is right.
- **Output contracts**: when something parses the output, show the exact shape.

Flag as dated:

| Pattern | Why it hurts now | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| All-caps MUST / NEVER / CRITICAL, stacked emphasis, threats | Over-triggering and rigid behavior; when everything is critical nothing is | Normal voice, one statement, with the reason |
| "Think step by step", scratchpad or `<thinking>` instructions | Models reason natively; this adds cost or gets refused as reasoning extraction | Remove |
| Step-by-step choreography for judgment work | The model's own plan is usually better | State the goal, constraints, and done criteria; keep numbered steps only where order matters |
| Prohibition lists with no reasons | Can anchor the model toward the failure | Keep the ones that encode real constraints, with reasons; restate the rest positively |
| The same rule repeated across sections | Wasted effort reconciling wordings | Say it once, where it applies |
| Hedges on real requirements ("try to", "if possible") | Read literally as optional | State the requirement |
| Long worked examples, a single gold output | The model copies length and structure | Delete, or keep several short varied ones labeled illustrative; keep format-pinning examples |
| Verification nudges after every step, forced tool order | Over-verification, slower runs | One check at the end, or none |
| History narratives, incident IDs, pinned model versions | Authority comes from the rule, not the story; pinned models go stale | State the current rule |
| Arithmetic scoring or lookup tables the model must compute | Models are worse at arithmetic than code | Move to code or data |

Do not flag: a one-line role statement, a single end-of-prompt recap, emphasis on one instruction that is demonstrably underweighted, routing text in a skill or tool description (trigger text may be emphatic), or length alone. Cruft is specific dated instructions, not word count.

## Analyzer findings to down-rank

These analyzer patterns encode older advice. Report them as LOW at most, and only when the prompt shows the problem they describe:

- `missing_xml_structure`: XML tags help separate data from instructions; they are not required for structure.
- `suboptimal_example_count`, `examples_without_contrast`, `missing_examples`: examples are right for format-sensitive output, not a quota.
- `critical_info_buried`: matters for very long prompts only.

Never suggest adding emphasis or chain-of-thought instructions.

## Fix

With `--fix`, apply only HIGH certainty findings that have an auto-fix (`applyFixes` in the analyzer; for emphasis, `fixAggressiveEmphasis`). Preserve the author's structure and wording otherwise.

## Output

Per file:

```markdown
## Prompt Analysis: <name>
File: <path> | Type: <system|agent|skill|command|template> | ~<tokens> tokens

| Line | Issue | Fix | Certainty |
|---|---|---|---|
```

When called by an enhancer agent, return the findings JSON that agent specifies instead.
